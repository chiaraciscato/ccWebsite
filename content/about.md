While starting off as a social scientist focusing on international power structures and political law, I recently graduated from a Master's degree in Climate Studies, where I addressed the numerous facets of global climate change and environmental sustainability.

Throughout my academic career, I strengthened my scientific knowledge on climate mitigation and adaptation, ocean-based carbon dioxide removal, and earth system modelling. I acquired solid technical skills in data processing, analysis and visualisation of large geotemporal datasets. 

Given my diverse background, I advocate for interdisciplinary research, where social and natural sciences coexist and cooperate with the shared purpose of tackling global warming, ecosystem disruption, and climate-induced inequality. 

My professional ambition is to communicate climate science to the widest public through data-driven research. I am especially passionate about the polar oceans as regions of climate stabilisation and vulnerability.
